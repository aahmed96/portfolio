# Portfolio using React

## Getting started

### Installation

We first create the app using npm as follows:

`npx create-react-app mp_app`  
`cd my-app`  
`npm start` - This command starts the app

Next, we install react-bootstrap because we will be utilizing that for styling.  

`npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`  

Once we have these installed, we can start populating our app. Before we do that, let's understand how the app reacts.

### **Website structure**

1. **Components**: This is a folder inside source where all our JS files live. These are the pages or components we want to display! 

2. **App.js**:
This is where the main app lives. We import the components here. Make sure you import the relevant components 

### **Components**
Here, we discuss the development of components of our portfolio.  

**Header**

We first create the Navigation bar. For this, we take the code from bootstrap and edit it to our liking.
