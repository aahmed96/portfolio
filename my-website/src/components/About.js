                As a music producer, I found stunning parallels between engineering and music composition. Engineers take different raw materials and transform them into something useful just as a music composer takes different sounds and layers them to produce something beautiful. My passion for creation confirmed that my career will be in the sciences, where I can learn and reason from first principles to continuously innovate in a fast-paced world. Therefore, I choose to pursue an engineering science degree at Trinity University, which combines all the major disciplines of engineering, while also allowing me to specialize in Chemical Engineering. 
 I thrive in rapidly growing, fast paced, and innovative environments. I believe the key ingredient to success is persistence, and persistence only comes with passion and a vision for a more exciting future. My ambition to continuously learn new things has conditioned me into a fast learner. So far, my engineering degree has given me great problem solving, leadership and teamwork skills, while a liberal arts education has polished my emotional intelligence. As a recent graduate, Iâ€™m actively looking for companies that promote continuous learning and provide a challenging and striving work environment.
